## Directions:
<br>
- To start playing, press Beginner, Intermediate, or Expert. <br>
- These three difficulties have an associated board size and bomb count as outlined below.<br>
<br>
- Once you have chosen a difficulty, the game begins when you click a tile. <br>
- This first tile click is guaranteed not to be a bomb and will reveal neighboring tiles for you to continue playing.<br>
<br>
- Now there exists a certain amount of bombs on the board defined by your difficulty.<br>
- Your goal is to expose all spaces on the board that are not bombs (you expose a space by left clicking on it). <br>
- Every space that is not a bomb contains a count of how many bombs are in its surrounding eight spaces. <br>
- You can imagine these eight spaces as all spaces as a ring around a given tile. <br>
<br>
- If you believe you know a bomb is in a given space, you can right click to "flag" that space.<br>
- Note: It is not required to flag all bombs, but it is helpful in remembering where bombs might exist.<br>
- Once you have revealed all spaces that are not bomb: you win.<br>
- If you click a space that contains a bomb: you lose.<br>
- Good luck!<br>
